/**
 * Most commonly, {@link Alias} is used when naming a {@link Plugin} or a {@link Facet}, but it can also be used for
 * custom implementations when combined with the {@link ConstraintInspector#getName(Class)}.
 * <p/>
 * If two or more {@link Plugin} types share an alias, they must each declare a different {@link RequiresResource}). The
 * shell determines which {@link Plugin} to invoke when a {@link Resource} of the type requested by a
 * {@link RequiresResource} is currently in scope.
 * <p/>
 * Scopes and overloads are checked at boot time; if conflicts are detected, the shell will fail to boot. (No two
 * {@link Plugin} types or commands may declare the same {@link Alias} and {@link RequiresResource}). Similarly, no two
 * {@link Facet} types may use the same {@link Alias}.
